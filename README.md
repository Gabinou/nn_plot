## nnplot: Neural network visualization with Matplotlib
New classes are introduced that enable the plotting of neurons, any number of connexions, with weights represented by transparency√©
This code was created using code originally published on StackOverflow by users Milo and DenisFlash at the following url: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29888233/how-to-visualize-a-neural-network]
The code was intended to print neuron networks vertically, from the input layer (IL) at the bottom to the output layer (OL) at the top.
It has been pruned and modified to accomodate printing text in neurons, rotating the neuron stack horizontally (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED), etc.
